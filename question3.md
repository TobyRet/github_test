Explain what a branch is, in your own words
===========================================

A 'branch' is a copy of the code stored on the master branch. Any changes made in the branch, are only stored in the branch unless it is merged backed with the master branch. An example of when branching might be useful is when you want to create a new feature but prefer to keep the original code in tack until the feature is completed.

This is one of those concepts that I think might be best supported by a diagram!
